1/Sorting - Read and have ideas
+ Bubble sort (Need to implement by yourself desc vs asc)
	Example:
		Given:  [ 2, 6, 4, 9, 8]
		Output: [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 9]
+ Quick sort

2/Searching - Read and have ideas
+ Linear (Need to implement by yourself)
	Example:
		Given:  [ 2, 6, 4, 9, 8]
		Search : 4
		Return true or false
+ Binary

3/Practice for Recursive - Will upload later

4/Modify your previous sorting problems

PRIME NUMBER IMPROVEMENT
private static bool IsPrimeNumber(int givenNumber)
{
	Stopwatch sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();

	int counter = 0;

	for (int i = 2; i <= Math.Sqrt(givenNumber) + 1; i++)
	{
		if (givenNumber % i == 0)
			counter = 1;
	}

	Console.WriteLine("Took " + sw.ElapsedMilliseconds);

	if (counter == 0 && givenNumber != 1 && givenNumber != 0)
		return true;

	return false;
}
