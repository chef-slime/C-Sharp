1/ OOP Practice
	The Foobar Motor Company makes cars and vans,which when being built comprises (among lots of other things) a body shell, a chassis and glassware for the windows.
	Althogh both cars and vands need all of the same type of components, the specifics of each type differ depending upon whether it is being used for a car or a van.
	In other words:
	+ A car's body shell is different from a van's body shell
	+ A car's chassis is different from a van's chassis
	+ A car's glassware is different from a van's glassware
	
	Design your system to handle this business.
