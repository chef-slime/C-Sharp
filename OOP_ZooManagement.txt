There is a zoo, they come to our software company and asking for a management software.
The software is simple enough to allow a manager to:
+ know how many total animals are there
+ know how many animals per each category
+ add/remove an animal from any categories

Hints: 
+You need to think about how many animals categories out there? Just roughly on top of your head
+Which properties all animal have? Again, just roughly, not need to be 100% science here
+Then which properties, methods should be in a manager?
