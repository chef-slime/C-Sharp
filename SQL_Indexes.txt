ID	Name	Salary
1	Tina	20000
2	Annie	15000

CREATE INDEX idx_name
ON Persons (Name);

Database -> Create some kinds of sub-table/sub-set of data

Annie	Physical/Memory Address of Anna record
Tina	1


Search: Anna



SELECT * FROM Persons 
WHERE NAME = 'Anna';

1/ Look up 'Anna' in the index sub-table/sub-set
2/ It will get the ID
3/ It will go back to the Person Table and get the record for that found ID
	-> 2	Anna	15000


Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an update). So, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against.


clustered vs non-clustered indexes?
