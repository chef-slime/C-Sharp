1/ Write a method
	public static int max(int[][] a) 
that returns the maximum value in the 2d parameter array a.

2/ Write a method
	public static int rowSum(int[][] a, int x)
that returns the sum of the elements in Row x of a.

3/ Write a method
	public static int columnSum(int[][] a, int x)
that returns the sum of the elements in Column x of a (careful with rows of different lengths!).

4/ Write a method
	public static int[] allRowSums(int[][] a)
that calculates the row sum for every row and returns each of the values in an array. Index i of the return array contains the sum of elements in row i.

5/ Write a method
	public static boolean isRowMagic(int[][] a)
that checks if the array is row-magic (this means that every row has the same row sum).

6/ Write a method
	public static boolean isColumnMagic(int[][] a)
that checks if the array is column-magic (this means that every column has the same column sum).
