1/ An animal interface should have:
	string GetName() ->. Return the name of the animal
	int GetVelocity() ->  Return the velocity of that animal
	void Eat() -> Print the food for that animal
	
	Implement a few animal(at least 4) for that interface (you pick), example: 
	Class Cat : IAnimal
	{
		// Constructor, should have name and food, velocity
		public class Cat(...?,...?,...?)
		{
		}
	}
	
	
	In the main method, given a list of all animals, find the most velocity.
	Example: similar as The give list of Vehicles


2/ Define IShape:
	double Area() -> return the area of that shape
	
	Implement this shape for rectangle, square.
	
	P/s: Constructor should have height and width.
