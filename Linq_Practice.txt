...

var n = from x in arr1  
				group x by x into y  
				select y;  
				Console.WriteLine("\nThe number and the Frequency are : \n"); 
			    foreach (var arrNo in n)  
				{  
					Console.WriteLine("Number "+arrNo.Key + " appears " + arrNo.Count()+" times");  
				} 
        Console.WriteLine("\n");	

P/S: 2, 3, 4 use GROUP BY.
